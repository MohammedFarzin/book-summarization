**Summary of "The Psychology of Money" by Morgan Housel**

**5 Core Concepts:**

1. **Wealth is not the same as income:** Housel argues that wealth is the ability to live off your savings, while income is what you earn from your job.
2. **Money is behavior, not math:** The way people behave with money is more important than the numbers themselves.
3. **No one is crazy:** People's financial decisions make sense to them based on their own experiences and values.
4. **The role of luck:** Luck plays a much larger role in financial success than most people realize.
5. **Compounding is powerful:** Small, consistent investments over a long period of time can lead to significant wealth.

**Breakthrough Ideas:**

1. **The "Rule of 72":** This rule estimates how long it will take for an investment to double, based on its annual return.
2. **The "Safety Myth":** The idea that there is a "safe" investment that will never lose money is a myth.
3. **The "Career-Long View":** Thinking about your career in terms of decades, rather than years or months, can lead to better financial decisions.

**Quotable Insight:**
"The most important thing to realize is that you are not a spreadsheet. You are a person."

2. **Start investing:** Even small, consistent investments can add up over time.
