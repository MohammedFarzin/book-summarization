**Summary of "Atomic Habits" by James Clear**

- **5 Core Concepts:**
	1. **Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement:** Small, consistent actions can lead to significant changes over time.
	2. **Habits are systems, not goals:** Achieving a goal is a one-time event, while a habit is a repeated behavior.
	3. **Identity-based habits:** Focusing on who you want to be, rather than what you want to achieve, can lead to long-term success.
	4. **The four laws of behavior change:** Make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, make it satisfying.
	5. **The two-minute rule:** Break down habits into small, manageable tasks that take two minutes or less to complete.
- **Breakthrough Ideas:**
	1. **Habit stacking:** Combining new habits with existing ones can help to build consistency.
	2. **The Goldilocks rule:** Creating a habit that is neither too easy nor too hard can help to maintain motivation.
	3. **Tracking habits:** Measuring and tracking habits can provide feedback and accountability.
- **Quotable Insight:** "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."
- **Practical Applications:**
	1. **Choose a habit to focus on:** Identify a small, specific habit that you want to build or break.
	2. **Make it obvious:** Create a visual cue to remind yourself to do the habit.
	3. **Make it attractive:** Find a way to make the habit enjoyable or rewarding.
	4. **Make it easy:** Reduce the friction or barriers to doing the habit.
